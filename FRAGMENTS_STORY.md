## 🧠 Mental Health Connection

### **The Core Message**
> "You are not broken. You are just resetting."

The app uses **Earth breaking into fragments** as a story parallel to show what happens to our minds when stress builds up, routines never stop, and we never take time to rest.

### **How It Mirrors Mental Health**

| Concept | Mental Health Parallel |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Earth Cracking** | Emotional overwhelm & mental fragmentation |
| **Grey, Colorless World** | Depression, loss of joy, exhaustion |
| **Four Fragments** | Four essential mental reset practices |
| **Restoration Activities** | Therapeutic techniques for recovery |
| **Earth Reconnecting** | Integration and wholeness |

### **The Four Fragments & Mental Resets**

#### **Fragment 1: Pause** (Winter)
- **Visual:** Frozen, quiet, still world
- **Mental Meaning:** The importance of rest and recovery
- **Story:** Earth froze because it never paused from constant activity
- **Activity:** User taps or holds to slow the environment; light gradually returns
- **Lesson:** "Sometimes, the mind just needs to stop."

#### **Fragment 2: Reframe** (Spring)
- **Visual:** Messy world with broken shapes and scattered pieces
- **Mental Meaning:** Shifting perspective and finding new meaning
- **Story:** Earth looks broken until we see it differently
- **Activity:** User rearranges elements to create order and clarity
- **Lesson:** "Sometimes, a new perspective is all we need."

#### **Fragment 3: Decide** (Summer)
- **Visual:** Bright, fast, overwhelming environment
- **Mental Meaning:** Choosing calm over chaos; intentional decision-making
- **Story:** Earth becomes unstable without conscious choices
- **Activity:** User selects calmer paths to reduce chaos
- **Lesson:** "Sometimes, peace is a choice."

#### **Fragment 4: Disconnect** (Autumn)
- **Visual:** Quiet world with drifting pieces and open space
- **Mental Meaning:** Stepping away from stress and routine; creating space
- **Story:** Earth needs distance and quietness to reset
- **Activity:** User clears distractions and guides pieces to peace
- **Lesson:** "Sometimes, we need space to reconnect."

## 💬 Dialogue Flow

### **Opening Interaction**
The user is greeted warmly by Kibo:

**Kibo:** "Welcome, traveler. How are you today?"

**User chooses:**
1. "I'm not in a good mood"
2. "My mind feels full"
3. "I'm just exhausted"

### **Emotional Check-in Response**
**Kibo:** "Earth responds to what we carry inside. It has been holding this weight for a long time."

**User reflects:**
- "I usually ignore it"
- "I keep pushing through"
- "I never really stop"

### **Guided Journey**
Through each fragment, the dialogue reinforces the mental health message:

- **After Pause:** "That felt peaceful. I needed that."
- **After Reframe:** "That makes sense now. It feels clearer."
- **After Decide:** "I chose differently. That felt lighter."
- **After Disconnect:** "I feel lighter. That was quiet."

### **Closing Message**
**Kibo & Luma:** "You are not broken. You are just resetting."
